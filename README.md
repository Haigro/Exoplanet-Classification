# Exoplanet Classification Project

## Description
This project utilizes a data set published by NASA through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results/) to evaluate the uncertainty present in a simplified logistic regression model designed to identify exoplanets. This is accomplished using baysian logistic regression. A detailed analysis of this project can be found in the file "Project Report.pdf".

## Use
To run this project yourself, you must:
1. download both the data and code used in this project
   - Data: You will find the data used in this analysis in the file labeled "cumulative.csv".
   - Code: The analysis code is located in the file "Project.ipynb". 

2. ensure that you have the required packages installed
3. update the "path" variable in the first code cell to reflect the path of the data on your computer
4. run the notebook


Thank you for taking a look at our project!
