# Exoplanet Classification Project

## Description
This project utilizes a data set published by NASA through [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results/) to evaluate the uncertainty present in a simplified logistic regression model designed to identify exoplanets. This is accomplished using baysian logistic regression. A detailed analysis of this project can be found in the file "Project Report.pdf".

## Use
To run this project yourself, you must:
- download both the data and code used in this project
 - Data: You will find the data used in this analysis in the file labeled "cumulative.csv".
 - Code: The analysis code is located in the file "Project.ipynb". 

- ensure that you have the required packages installed
- update the "path" variable in the first code cell to reflect the path of the data on your computer
- run the notebook


Thank you for taking a look at our project!
